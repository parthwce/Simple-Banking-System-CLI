# Buggy Banking System üêõ

A simple banking CLI app with bugs and missing validations.  
Good project for Hacktoberfest contributions!

## Issues:

- Account creation does not check for duplicate account IDs.
- Deposits and withdrawals accept negative amounts incorrectly.
- Missing data persistence (in-memory only).
- Error messages are unclear or missing.
